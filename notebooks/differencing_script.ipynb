    "Where:\n",
    "- X_Y  represents the lower-left corner coordinates of the tile (for example, 640000_4310000)  \n",
    "- YEAR is the year tag, such as 2012 or 2018  \n",
    "- METRIC is the metric name in lowercase (chm, dtm, canopy_cover, densitygt2m, rumple)  \n",

    "### 3.5 Overviews & VRTs\n",
    "The following Python functions automate post‑processing of GeoTIFF outputs, adding internal overviews for fast display and building VRT mosaics for seamless GIS loading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overviews are reduced‐resolution \"pyramids\" that live inside a GeoTIFF. When a GIS application (such as QGIS) displays a large raster at small scales (zoomed out), it can load these lower‐resolution layers instead of the full‑resolution data. This dramatically improves rendering speed and interactivity without creating separate .ovr files, because the pyramids are embedded directly in the TIFF.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VRT is an XML index file that points to multiple source rasters and presents them as one seamless dataset. Instead of physically merging tiles into a large GeoTIFF (which duplicates data and consumes disk space), a VRT lists the locations of each tile on disk. When loaded in GIS, the VRT behaves like a single raster layer, enabling easy panning and zooming across many tiles without additional storage overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function: `add_overviews`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function adds *overview pyramids* (lower-resolution previews) inside each GeoTIFF so that large rasters load much faster in GIS tools like QGIS. These pyramids help with smooth zooming and panning at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `base`: The main folder where all the TIFFs are stored (it checks inside subfolders too).\n",
    "* `levels`: A list of how much to shrink the image for each overview. For example, `[2, 4, 8, 16]` creates 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 scale versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It walks through all subfolders in `base`, looking for `.tif` files (ignoring `.vrt` files).\n",
    "* For each TIFF, it builds a command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ['gdaladdo', '-r', 'average', path, '2', '4', '8', '16']\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `gdaladdo`: GDAL's tool to add overviews.\n",
    "  * `-r average`: Uses the average of neighboring pixels when downsampling.\n",
    "  * `path`: The full path to the raster.\n",
    "  * The numbers specify the zoom levels to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It then runs that command using Python's `subprocess` module. If something goes wrong, it'll raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it's useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Without overviews, big rasters can be really slow to open or navigate. With them, an instant map is generated with previews and smooth interaction, even with huge datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Function: `build_vrt`\n",
    "\n",
    " Create a Virtual Raster (VRT) that stitches individual TIFF tiles into one seamless layer without data duplication. VRTs enable single‐file loading in GIS while preserving tile metadata and georeferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `parent_dir`: Top‐level folder containing the tile subfolder.\n",
    "   * `subfolder`: Name of the directory with `.tif` files (e.g., `Placer_2012_Tiled` or `CHM_Diff`).\n",
    "   * `prefix`: Base name for the output VRT (e.g., `CHM`).\n",
    "   * `tag`: Timepoint or variant tag appended to the VRT name (e.g., `2012`, `Diff`).\n",
    "   * `nodata`: Numeric code representing empty pixels in differenced rasters (default `-9999`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Collect TIFF paths**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     tifs = sorted([os.path.join(src, f) for f in os.listdir(src) if f.lower().endswith('.tif')])\n",

    "   * **Filelist creation**:\n",
    "     Writes each TIFF path (with forward slashes) to a text file named `<prefix>_<tag>_filelist.txt`. GDAL uses this list to know which files to mosaic.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Determine VRT path**:\n",
    "     `<parent_dir>/<prefix>_<tag>.vrt`\n",
